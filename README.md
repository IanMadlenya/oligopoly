Marco Mazzoli, Matteo Morini and Pietro Terna

Model and its construction are reported in [Oligopoly.pdf](Oligopoly.pdf).

We have also the [slides](slides_of_a_presentazione_of_the_model.pdf) of the presentation of the model at [WEHIA 2017](http://www.wehia2017.com).

A recent paper [(Business Cycle in a Macromodel with Oligopoly and Agents' Heterogeneity: An Agent-Based Approach, 2017)](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s40797-017-0058-y?author_access_token=vjDZsvCU0oSWIIYZ3I29c_e4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY7_M5DUq8hCn77TEQ7dIoockg0M5bs0KRNXV7xG9MosbmD22MVHEyYi2Hagw-CHS6AIbo9_gdi2cn_YQ9rtzqbZqjqBJQ0qb2sTTlyZLgGMUw==) of M.Mazzoli, M.Morini, and P.Terna, is using SLAPP as agent-based modeling shell.
